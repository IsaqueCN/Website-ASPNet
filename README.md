# Website ASPNet

I have decided to make a website from scratch using ASP.Net Core using the Empty template on Visual Studio Code 2022!
This is so I improve my skills and learn more about how to create with ASP.Net Core.

**My goals as of 02/28/2025:**

Make a fully working API with appropiate responses using a MySQL local server and enable the user to use it through the website!
